 <h1>ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING</h1> 
<hr>
	Electronics Engineering, or Electronic Engineering, is an engineering discipline which utilizes non-linear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistors, diodes and integrated circuits) to design electronic circuits, devices,Microprocessors/Microcontrollers and systems including VHDL Modelling for Programmable logic devices and FPGAs. The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards.

             The term "Electronic Engineering" denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as analog electronics, electronics, consumer, embedded systems and power electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of applications, principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control, signal processing, systems engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, control, robotics, and many others.

<h2>LABORATORY FACILITIES</h2>
	In order to ensure high standards of education for its students, the department has constantly upgraded itself by adding well-equipped and fully furnished laboratories to supplement the theory courses. Old laboratories like the Analog Electronics Lab and the Microprocessor labs have been upgraded with state-of-the-art equipments.
