Mechanical Engineering is the mother of all Branches of Engineering. It is a very broad field that includes the applications of physical principles for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. The curriculum of mechanical engineering also incorporates the study of like fuels, energy, renewable energy, thermal engineering, mechatronics, engineering materials, production process, heat engine, automobile, hydraulic refrigeration and air conditioning, and engineering mechanics and design. Moreover, the students will get a basic knowledge in Mathematics, and in English communication, Life skills, science disciplines and engineering subjects which includes civil, mechanical, electrical and electronics engineering. During the study, the students have to undergo in-plant training of their choice related to mechanical fields, so that they can enhance their knowledge theoretically and practically.

             Apart from that students have to submit a project report on the basis of the project work they have done. On completing the course one can seek employment either in private or public sector industries. They can seek employment in government departments like Post and Telegraphs, Defense, PWD, and CPWD, Other departments such as aeronautical, agricultural, automobile, chemical, and power plants, as well as in the railways as they need mechanical engineers to design and maintain their machinery. Mechanical Engineers also mostly required in automobile, chemical, electronics, steel plants, oil exploration and refining, and technical wings of armed forces, space research organizations etc. Also they have the opportunity for opting higher studies leading to B.Tech/B.E. in mechanical engineering at various institutions in India including IITs and NITs.
